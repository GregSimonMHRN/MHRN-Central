These documents represent the universe of mental health diagnosis codes used by the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN.)  These lists change over time are are often subsetted or augmented for specific projects, as described in publication methods or project documentation.

* MHRN1_Diagnosis list.xls is a human-readable compilation that was used for the descriptive analyses performed in MHRN I (2010-14.)  It is available in IDC-9 coding only.  This was largely implemented using a SAS macro, an example of which can be found in dxmacro.txt, although a SAS dataset is also available (dxlist.zip)

* MHRN2_Diagnosis list.xls is a human-readable compilation that was used for the descriptive analyses performed in MHRN II (2015-19.)  This has been implemented using a SAS macro, a format, and as a SAS dataset derived from the comma-delimited file below.  It has been implemented in ICD-9 and a draft ICD-10 version is included.

* ICD9_10_MHRN_DX_DEFS_working.csv is suitable for reading into a dataset.  It contains both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.

* dx_macro.txt - this is provided for historical information.  It is not currently in use.  Use for reference only.

* dxlist.zip - zipped SAS dataset of MHRN I (ICD-9) diagnosis codes by category.
