Changes and updates to code lists:

Drugs:  NDCs are continually added by manufacturers.  We update our list approximately annually, using a combination of FirstDataBank and RXnorm.

Diagnoses:  Categories were added for MHRN II.  ICD-9 codes were in use in the US until October 2015.  Our ICD-10 lists are in development and should be considered preliminary.

Procedure codes:  Mental Health Specialty cpt4 codes and specifically our definition of psychotherapy is included.  A few new codes were introduced and others retired at the beginning of 2013.  We keep all these codes in the file, so it is backward-compatible.
